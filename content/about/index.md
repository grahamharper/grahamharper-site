# About

Hi ðŸ‘‹<br>
I'm Graham, an experienced design leader based in Dublin, Ireland and specialize in designing products, leading teams and solving problems. With a strong background in both design and development, I bridge the gap between intent and execution. I'm driven by solving real, human problems and delivering exceptional outcomes.

## My Journey

My journey in the world of design and development began with a deep fascination for technology and its potential to drive positive change. Over the years, I have had the privilege of working with some of the most vulnerable people in our society. It's this experience that has inspired me to use design and technology to improve peoples lives.

## Work

In my role at Merative (formerly IBM Watson Health), I focus on crafting solutions tailored to the unique needs of governments striving to improve the delivery of health and human services. I firmly believe that technology has the power to enhance the lives of citizens and make government services more accessible and efficient. My work centers on designing and developing user-friendly interfaces that facilitate communication, streamline processes, and ensure that essential services reach those who need them most.
