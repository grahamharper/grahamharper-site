Hi ðŸ‘‹<br>
I'm Graham, a design lead based in Dublin, Ireland.

I'm passionate about using design and technology to meaningfully improve peoples lives. I specialise in design systems, strategy and crafting user experiences that solve problems in complex environments, driving exceptional outcomes.

Currently I'm Principal Designer at [CÃºram by Merative](https://www.merative.com/curam), where I lead the design team transforming the delivery of government social services.

## My Journey

My journey in the world of design began with a deep fascination for technology and its potential to drive positive change. Over the years, I have had the privilege of working with some of the most vulnerable people in our society. It's this experience that has inspired me to use design and technology to improve peoples lives.

Throughout my career as a designer I have maintained a balance of skills across design and web development, letting each discipline inform and enhance the other. It is this intersection of skills that enables me to bridge the gap between designers and developers, intent and execution. Design Systems are where these skills manifest.

More recently my focus has shifted from design output to driving positive _outcomes_, by solving problems for humans through design.

## Work

In my role at Merative (formerly IBM Watson Health), I focus on crafting solutions tailored to the unique needs of governments striving to improve the delivery of health and human services. I firmly believe that technology has the power to enhance the lives of citizens and make government services more accessible and efficient. My work centers on designing and developing user-friendly interfaces that facilitate communication, streamline processes, and ensure that essential services reach those who need them most.
